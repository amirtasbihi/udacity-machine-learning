# Udacity Machine Learning

Udacity has several online programs and courses. Machine Learning Nanodegree is one of the popular programs that covers a subset of  Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the name of Machine Learning.

Students have to work on and submit several projects in different fields in machine learning. Tasks include but not limited to Classification, Regression, Reinforcement Learning, Clustering and etc.

This repository includes some of those projects.

Most of these projects are written in Python and they use open source libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow and many others.

### Customer Segmentation
A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week.Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries — losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. You’ve been hired by the wholesale distributor to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future. Your task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.
